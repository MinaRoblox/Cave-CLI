# Cave-CLI: A game entirely made in the terminal of Python

This is a very simple game and it's in a very early state.
Here, I am gonna explain the files that live inside this repository.

# sprites.py

Contains the assets for the game, the assets are mostly just a lot
of strings.

# game.py

The main code for the game.

# install_libraries.sh

A simple way to install libraries or modules to the virtual enviroment. I wanted an excuse to make everything a .sh file.

# run.sh

Can run the game without needing to activate the virtul enviroment.

# gameEngineLibraries.py

Cointains the libraries used in game.py
